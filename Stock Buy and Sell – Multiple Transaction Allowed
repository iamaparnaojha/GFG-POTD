Problem: 
Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Multiple Transaction Allowed
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

Code:
class Solution {
  public:
    int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int ans=0,n= prices.size();
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(prices[i]>prices[i-1]){
                ans+=prices[i]-prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
